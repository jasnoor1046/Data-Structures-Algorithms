# Arrays

This folder contains problems based on the **Array data structure**, which forms the foundation of most algorithmic problem solving.
The focus here is not just solving problems, but identifying **common patterns**, understanding **trade-offs**, and handling **edge cases** correctly.


# 🧠 Core Patterns Covered

The following patterns are practiced extensively using array-based problems:

- Traversal & basic manipulation
- Two pointers
- Sliding window (fixed & variable size)
- Prefix sum & suffix sum
- Kadane’s Algorithm
- Frequency counting
- In-place modification
- Sorting-based techniques

Each problem file clearly mentions the **pattern used**.


## 📂 Problems Included

Some of the types of problems covered in this folder include:

- Finding maximum / minimum values
- Subarray and subsequence problems
- Maximum subarray sum (Kadane)
- Array rotation and rearrangement
- Duplicate and frequency-based problems
- Range-based queries using prefix sums

(File names are descriptive to reflect the problem being solved.)


## 🛠️ How Solutions Are Written

Each `.cpp` file follows a consistent structure:

- Problem description
- Approach and reasoning
- Pattern identification
- Time and space complexity
- Edge cases handled

The aim is to make each solution **easy to revise and explain in interviews**.


## ⚠️ Common Mistakes Addressed

While solving array problems, special attention is given to:

- Off-by-one errors
- Empty or single-element arrays
- Negative numbers and overflow cases
- Time complexity pitfalls 

These are explicitly considered in solutions.


## 🎯 Goal of This Section

- Build strong intuition for array-based problems
- Learn to recognize reusable patterns
- Write optimized and readable solutions
