# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains my structured practice of **Data Structures and Algorithms** using **C++**.
The goal of this repo is not just to store solutions, but to clearly document **problem-solving approaches, patterns, and reasoning** behind each solution.
This repository reflects how I think, analyze, and optimize problems — not just whether the code runs.

 # 📌 Purpose of This Repository

- Build strong fundamentals in Data Structures & Algorithms
- Practice **pattern-based problem solving**
- Write **clean, readable, and well-documented code**
- Create an interview-ready reference for revision
- Track consistent learning progress (quality > quantity)

# 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized **topic-wise**, not platform-wise.


Each topic folder contains:
- Well-named problem files
- Code written in C++
- Clear explanation of the approach
- Time & space complexity analysis
- Edge cases and common pitfalls


# 🧠 How to Read This Repository

1. Start with the **topic folder**
2. Read the folder-level `README.md` (if present) to understand patterns
3. Open individual problem files
4. Read the **approach comment at the top** before reading the code
5. Focus on *why* the solution works, not just *what* it does


## 🧩 Problem-Solving Philosophy

While solving problems, I follow this approach:
- Understand constraints and edge cases first
- Start with brute force if needed
- Identify repeating patterns (sliding window, two pointers, etc.)
- Optimize time and space where possible
- Write readable code with meaningful variable names

Each solution prioritizes **clarity and reasoning** over clever hacks.


## ⚙️ Language & Tools

- Language: **C++**
- IDE: Visual Studio Code
- Concepts emphasized:
  - Time–space tradeoffs
  - Pattern recognition
  - Clean code practices


# 🚀 Current Focus

- Core data structures (Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists)
- Common interview patterns
- Writing explanations alongside code

More topics will be added progressively as learning deepens.


# 📎 Note

This repository is a **learning log**, not a competitive programming dump.
Code is written and refined deliberately after understanding the underlying concept.


## ⭐ If You’re Reviewing This Repo

- Judge the **structure and clarity**
- Focus on **approach explanations**
- This repo reflects learning depth, not problem count
